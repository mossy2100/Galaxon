# Astronomy
A C# library for astronomical calculations and for creating and interacting with a database of
astronomical objects.

This is a work in progress, and not ready for community use as yet.

Feel free to browse, though, if you want to see what I'm up to :)

Depends on Core, Time, Numerics, and Development.
